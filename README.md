# Sales Forecasting with CatBoost: A Predictive Model for Business Insights

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to predict future sales in a retail environment. Using the CatBoostRegressor model, a gradient boosting algorithm known for its efficiency and accuracy with structured data, this model aims to forecast sales based on historical store data.

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a model that can accurately forecast sales, providing valuable insights for inventory management, marketing strategies, and business decision-making.

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains historical sales data for a set of stores, including features such as store information, sales data, and time-related variables. The data was preprocessed to handle missing values, categorical variables, and outliers to ensure the model can learn effectively.

## Approach:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Missing values were handled using the mode for categorical columns and the median for numerical columns. Categorical variables were encoded using one-hot encoding to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms.
   
2. **Model Selection:** CatBoost, a state-of-the-art gradient boosting model, was selected for its ability to handle large datasets efficiently while providing high predictive performance. Hyperparameters were fine-tuned to optimize the model.
   
3. **Feature Engineering:** Key features were extracted from the data, including time-related features such as the day of the week, month, and seasonal variations, which are crucial for predicting sales in a time-series context.
   
4. **Evaluation:** The model’s performance was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure the accuracy of the forecasts.

5. **Feature Importance:** The impact of each feature on the model’s predictions was analyzed and visualized, providing insights into the most influential factors driving sales.

## Outcome:
The trained model is capable of providing reliable sales forecasts, helping businesses make data-driven decisions regarding inventory, promotions, and staffing. The ability to explain the model’s predictions through feature importance adds transparency and trust to the results.

## Next Steps:
Future enhancements could involve further fine-tuning of the model, incorporating additional features such as weather data or economic indicators, and exploring more advanced models like XGBoost or neural networks.
